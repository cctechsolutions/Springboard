/* Welcome to the SQL mini project. You will carry out this project partly in
the PHPMyAdmin interface, and partly in Jupyter via a Python connection.

This is Tier 2 of the case study, which means that there'll be less guidance for you about how to setup
your local SQLite connection in PART 2 of the case study. This will make the case study more challenging for you: 
you might need to do some digging, aand revise the Working with Relational Databases in Python chapter in the previous resource.



/* QUESTIONS 



/* Q1: Some of the facilities charge a fee to members, but some do not.
Write a SQL query to produce a list of the names of the facilities that do. */

QUERY:

OUTPUT:

/* Q2: How many facilities do not charge a fee to members? */

QUERY:

/* Q3: Write an SQL query to show a list of facilities that charge a fee to members,
where the fee is less than 20% of the facility's monthly maintenance cost.
Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the
facilities in question. */

***** I was consistently getting a 403 error when combining the member first and last names despite double and triple checking query syntax, attempting suggestions and alternative methods found on stack overflow, and trying the same using the site in other browsers.  My mentor advised me to skip that part of the instructions and just focus on the rest of the questions.  This affects Q7, Q8, and Q9.  *****
